# Understanding GraphRAGs

GraphRAGs represent an exciting evolution in how we augment large language models with real-time, contextual data.

## What are RAGs?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems help solve the problem of frozen training data by fetching relevant, up-to-date information to supplement LLM responses.

## Enter GraphRAGs

GraphRAGs take this further by understanding relationships between entities in a graph structure. This means better context awareness and more relevant retrievals.

### How They Work

When you have a graph of, say, a project with people connected to it, there's correlation between what you're doing and what others are doing. If a team member sends you an email, GraphRAGs can provide additional context based on these relationships.

## Benefits

- More contextual responses
- Better understanding of relationships
- Enhanced relevance in information retrieval
